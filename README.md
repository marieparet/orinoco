## What is this project ?

This is the Project number 5 of the OpenClassrooms' Web Developer course, in which I had to create an e-commerce website in JavaScript.

## What did I learn ?

This project allowed me to acquire basic JavaScript skills, such as handling :

- arrays
- objects
- loops
- promises
- events
- etc

It also enabled me to gain some important browser API knowledge, such as :

- fetch
- query params
- localStorage

Besides, this project helped me grasp the concept of unit testing in order to cover the majority of the code base, by testing individual units and components of source code.

Finally, I also learnt how to simplify and quicken CSS implementation by using Bootstrap.
