## What is this project ?

This is the Project number 5 of the OpenClassrooms' Web Developer course, in which I had to create an e-commerce website in JavaScript.

## What did I learn ?

This project allowed me to acquire basic JavaScript skills, such as handling :
- arrays
- objects
- loops
- promises
- etc

It also enabled me to gain some important browser API knowledge, such as : 
- fetch
- query params
- localStorage

I also learnt how to simplify and quicken CSS implementation by using Bootstrap.
